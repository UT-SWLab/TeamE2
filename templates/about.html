                <p style="margin: auto">This site displays Formula 1 statistics, aggregated from multiple public APIs. The site features hisotrical and current data for things ranging from drivers to constructors to circuits. The goal of the website is to combine all these components into one easy to access site. Users that would benefit from this site include Formula 1 team members, Formula 1 fans, sport analysts, or anyone else looking to improve their understanding of Formula 1. </p>

                <h3 class="about-h3">What did we find out?</h3>
                <p style="margin: auto">By integrating the data from multiple sources into one cohesive locataion, we hope to produce an accurate analysis of Formula 1 trends, best drivers, most successful constructors, and circuit timings. The multiple data sources allow for the site to have a broader scope of information, as well as giving us the ability to verify the integrity of each source. Any incomplete information can be complemented by data from another source, creating a full picture. From the data, one interesting result that the team saw is how "top-heavy" modern Formula 1 has become. The same drivers and constructors dominate the leaderboards. This is most notable with Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes, who handsomely win most races due to their advanced tech and driving skills.

                <ul>

                    <li class="list-bullet">Flask</li>

                    <p>Flask is the Python web application microframework used for the site. Its lightweight characteristics allow for quick deployment of applications with minimum overhead.</p>

                    <li class="list-bullet">Bootstrap 4</li>

                    <p>Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework used to build responsive front-end designs. Its layout components allow the site to maintain its design regardless of screen size.</p>

                    <li class="list-bullet">MongoDB</li>
                    <p>MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program. It was used to house all of the data for the website's models, namely drivers, constructors, and circuits. MongoDB gave the team to quickly and efficiently pull data and update as necessary.</p>
                    <li class="list-bullet">Selenium</li>
                    <p>Selenium is a testing framework used for web applications. It was used to test the GUI components of the site, ensuring all interactive features were working as expected. It was also used to verify all links on the website lead to the correct destination.</p>
                    <li class="list-bullet">Python unittest</li>
                    <p>Python unittest is a unit testing framework that is similar to most testing frameworks found in other languages (notably JUnit). This was used to test the create, read, update, and delete components of the team's MongoDB collections.</p>

        <div class="ml-md-5">
            <div>
                <h3 class="about-h3">Data Sources</h3>
                <p>The data was taken from public Formula 1 REST APIs using the Python requests library. The team used HTTP requests to retrieve the relevant data in JSON form and stored it in the team project MongoDB database. While MongoDB provides unique object IDs for documents, the team used a system of interger IDs to easily reference different drivers, circuits, and constructors.</p>
