## Environment Setup:
You will need a working version of Python 3 installed on your computer. Create the virtual environment using this command:

Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
Windows: `py -m venv env`

Once you have created the environment, activate the environment with this command:

`source env/bin/activate`

With the environment active, install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file with this command:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
