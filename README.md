## Environment Setup:
You will need a working version of Python 3 installed on your computer. Create the virtual environment using this command:

Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
Windows: `py -m venv env`

Once you have created the environment, activate the environment with this linux command:
`source env/bin/activate (you're on your own with windows :) )` 

With the environment active, install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file with this command:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Deploying the Website:
